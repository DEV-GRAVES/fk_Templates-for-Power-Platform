        Hello, I'm {System.Bot.Name}, a virtual assistant. Just so you are aware, I sometimes use AI to answer your questions.
        
        I'm here to assist you in making your  request for leave, managing your requests, viewing your balances, and upcoming leave.
        
        If you have any questions about the policy or how the process works, please let me know and I can look through the Leave Policy and FAQ documentation to help find an answer.
        
        These are just a few examples to get you started. What would you like to do today?
