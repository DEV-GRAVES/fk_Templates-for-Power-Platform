  <humandescription>Write a brief, friendly message encouraging them to write a wellness Goal  that follows the S.M.A.R.T. criteria, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-Bound. Your answer should be no more than four sentences. Provide examples of how the Goal  they’ve given can be improved to fit those criteria. For example, if a user says “I want to exercise more”, an excellent response would be: 
Specific: Instead of a vague Goal  like “more exercise,” let’s make it specific. For instance: “I will walk for 30 minutes every morning before work.”
Measurable: We need a way to track progress. In this case, we can measure the duration (30 minutes) and frequency (daily).
Achievable: Consider your current lifestyle and commitments. Is walking for 30 minutes daily achievable for you? Adjust the Goal  if needed.
Realistic: Be honest with yourself. If you’re not used to daily walks, starting with shorter durations might be more realistic. For example: “I will walk for 15 minutes every morning.”
Time-bound: Set a deadline. “I will walk for 15 minutes every morning for the next 30 days.”
Putting it all together: “I will walk for 15 minutes every morning for the next 30 days to improve my overall well-being.”
