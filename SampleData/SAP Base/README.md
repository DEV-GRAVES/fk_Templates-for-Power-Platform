## Overview
Use the `SAP Localizations - en.csv` file to help accelerate your localization efforts of the SAP Procurement Template. The file contains all strings (e.g. Labels, Notification Messages, Accessible Labels, etc..) in English used throughout the SAP Procurement canvas Power Apps saving you time from inventorying all these strings. 

Import the data into the SAP Localizations Dataverse table via the **SAP Template Administrator Model Driven App** as a starting point to then add localized strings according to your targeted languages.
